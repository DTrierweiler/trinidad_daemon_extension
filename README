Trinidad Daemon Extension
=======

# DESCRIPTION

Extension to run Trinidad server as a daemon.

[WARNING] This extension only works with Trinidad 0.8.3 or above.

# INSTALLATION

jruby -S gem install trinidad_daemon_extension

# USAGE

This extension can be enabled from the Trinidad's configuration file or from the command line.
It uses a temporal directory to write the pid file but its route can be overrided.

  * To enable it from the configuration file you have to add a section "extensions" to the root of the file and the section "daemon" to this one. The pid file can be specified there:

    --
      extensions:
        daemon:
          pid_file: ./trinidad.pid # this is optional by default the extension writes the pid file into a temporal directory.

  * To enable it from the command line you have to load the extension first and the add one of these options:

     -d, --daemonize [PID_FILE]

     for instance: 

     $ jruby -S trinidad --load daemon --daemonize ./trinidad.pid

# TODO

  * enable logging. Right now the Tomcat's log is not written anywhere.
