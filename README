Trinidad Daemon Extension
=======

# DESCRIPTION

Extension to run Trinidad server as a daemon.

[WARNING] This extension only works with Trinidad 0.8.3 or above.

# INSTALLATION

jruby -S gem install trinidad_daemon_extension

# USAGE

This extension can be enabled from the Trinidad's configuration file or from the command line.
It uses a temporal directory to write the pid file but its route can be overrided.

  * To enable it from the configuration file you have to add a section "extensions" to the root of the file and the section "daemon" to this one. The pid file can be specified there:

    ---
      extensions:
        daemon:
          pid_file: ./trinidad.pid # this is optional by default the extension writes the pid file into a temporal directory.

  * To enable it from the command line you have to load the extension first and then add one of these options:

     -d, --daemonize [PID_FILE]

     for instance: 

     $ jruby -S trinidad --load daemon --daemonize ./trinidad.pid

The log file where the daemon writes its logs is also configurable from the trinidad's configuration file.
By default it writes the logs into the file log/trinidad.log with the level INFO, to modify this behaviour you just need to add these lines under the daemon configuration:

    ---
      extensions:
        daemon:
          log:
            file: trinidad.log # where the daemon writes its output
            level: ALL # severity level, it cn be one of these: ALL, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST, INFO, OFF, SEVERE, WARNING
